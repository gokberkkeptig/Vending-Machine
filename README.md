# Vending-Machine
In this programming assignment, you will be implementing a program that simulates a vending machine, i.e. the sale of items, coin counting and change giving. This vending machine will work as follows. A customer will first deposit an initial amount of money and then select an item from the vending machine. Your program must check that the customer makes a valid selection. If it is a valid selection, then the price of selected item will be deducted from the initial deposit and also the number of items in your vending machine will be updated accordingly. Once the customer has finished his/her selection, then your vending machine calculates the denominations of coins that are to be returned to the customer as change. Assume that only 1 TL, 0.5 TL, 0.20 TL, 0.10 TL and 0.05 TL coins are available for making change. With this vending machine, assume that the customer can select only one item at a time. There are 10 of each item at the beginning of each day. If a customer selects an item that is no longer available, then the vending machine will display an error message. Your vending machine starts when it is switched on and only stops when power is shut off. In this vending machine, the following selections are on offer: 1. Water 1.00 TL 2. Coke 1.20 TL 3. Diet Coke 1.20 TL 4. Iced Tea 1.00 TL 5. Swiss Chocolate 1.50 TL 6. Candy 0.95 TL 7. Chips 2.50 TL 8. Bubble Gum 1.50 TL 9. Turkish Delight 2.00 TL
